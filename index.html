            <p>PHOENIX is a dark fantasy drama, narrated like a greek tragedy. An immersive sim set in a <span class="text-demonic">mystic</span> valley of conflict and <span class="text-blood">decay</span>, a world designed by hand and full of atmospheric density, with unique aesthetics and oldschool graphic style from the 90s.</p>

            <p>Based on and conceived as a genuine reboot of <a href="https://www.gog.com/de/game/gothic">GOTHIC</a> (which had 'Phoenix' as its working title), we are inspired by the vision as it was presented from 1998 to 2000 by the four founders of the <a href="https://gothicarchive.org/developers/piranhabytes/presentation.html">old Piranha Bytes</a>, that we have preserved in our <a href="https://gothicarchive.org/" target="_blank">Gothic Archive</a>.

            <p>We do not attempt to reconstruct one specific alpha version or to shape the game according to the ideas of one specific founder. They had contradictory ideas, shaping the final product into a mere fragment of their original vision and culminating in a conflict about a worthy successor, that led to the cancellation of the first, forgotten
            <a href="https://gothicarchive.org/artworks/sequel.html" target="_blank">Gothic Sequel</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>What we attempt to achieve is to unite the different ideas from all periods of development. We want to realise this diverse dream, as we imagined the game to be by the words written and images shown to us before release, to reconstruct and turn it into one harmonious and coherent whole and to go beyond in that we try to max out the radical potential of GOTHIC, as we dream beyond industrial constraints. PHOENIX is what GOTHIC should have been. PHOENIX is to GOTHIC what Oblivion Lost is to STALKER.</p> 

            <p>PHOENIX is <em>not</em> an official game of the GOTHIC franchise, it's a non-commercial project by a small indie team (<a href="https://phoenixtales.de" target="_blank">Phoenix Tales</a>) and a pure labour of love. We try to realise the contradictory ideas of the founders, bring them to an end, and maybe thereby help, at least a bit, to heal the old wounds of their clash of dreams.</p>
    
            <!--<p>We need your help to realise this dream. You can <a href="https://phoenixtales.de/contrib.html" target="_blank">contribute</a> to our project, <a href="https://phoenixtales.de/team.html#donate" target="_blank">donate</a> or support us by promoting our ideas.</p>-->

            <p class="mb-8">You are thrown into a self-organised penal colony without guards, sealed from the outside world through a magical barrier; a prison full of convicts which only serve one purpose - mining the precious magical ore to fuel the kingdom's war outside. Experience anarchy: Gangs with different ideologies and brutal force govern the world of the condemned. Your goal is to survive and to escape.</p>

            <h3><strong class="text-orange">ACT II: NEMESIS</strong> <span class="subheader">[The Sequel: Chapter 7-11]</span></h3>
            <p class="mb-8">You wake up from months of unconsciousness to walk through the ruins of the prison you tried to escape from - still trapped inside. Dive into a world of refugees, fleeing from a war of prophetic cause. You are on a mission to end war - in four special and unique plots depending on your chosen faction.</p>

                        Intuitive and minimalistic user interface. Direct optical feedback; what you see is what you get. Everything is visualised on your player character in third person: clothes, weapons and even skills. Every gameplay element (HUD, attributes, skills, quest journal, teachers) is seamlessly integrated into the game lore. Real time, tactical combat and monster based puzzles. Immersive crafting in animated, individual steps. No rendered cutscenes breaking immersion, just ingame scenes and tracking shots inside the engine. Everything NPCs can interact with can be interacted with by the player as well. Gameplay focused on dialogues, exploration and survival. Realistically limited inventory. Different playstyles, determined by your immersively chosen class. Easy to understand, hard to master. Improve your character by following the story and by acting in accordance with the role you want to play. You improve your attributes through what we call
                        <em>learning-by-acting</em> (not learning by doing). Skills you learn ingame from teachers. No Levels, no grinding, no EXPs, no skill trees, just roleplay.

                        A dense and detailed game world featuring only genuine content while avoiding any ‘filling’ elements. We believe that density, rather than size is key: A small game world, not seen as a concession but rather as a conscious decision in favor of higher content density. Every plant, every tree, every item, chest and NPC is placed by hand. NPCs and monsters do not wait or spawn for the player, they have their own simulated life and schedules. No building is mere scenery (unlike the Witcher), every building is walkable and individually designed without loading screen breaks (unlike TES). All NPCs, especially traders, have individual inventories. All characters are unique, drawn from more than one hundred face and clothing texture variations. NPCs react to the player’s guild, clothing and actions.

                        <a href="img/dramatispersonae.png" target="_blank">Narrated like a greek tragedy</a>, structured in chapters, like a virtual tale. Every quest is linked to the main storyline and tied to a believable motivation of the player character. Plots unfold differently depending on the class acquired ingame. Several unforeseen story twists and events including visible changes and developments inside the game world. Different ways to solve missions with different outcomes and consequences. Multicomplex and multimedia-based story presentation inside (by dialogues, scriptures, artworks, locations, visual language) and outside (comics etc.) the game. Completely voiced dialogues (in the german version).
